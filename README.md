## Why is it needed?
Since 2022, LoliLand has started using the new Minecraft texture style (1.14.4+) in its unique modifications. But against this background, outdated textures from other modifications look bad, not logical and just strange. Our pack will fix this.
## Features
All textures, including objects, blocks, entity, GUI, and others have been redrawn and adapted to the LoliLand project.
## Addon's
1. [BlackTheme](https://github.com/PoTTall-Official/LoliLand-Black) - Change white theme to black in AE2 and some vanilla GUI's.
